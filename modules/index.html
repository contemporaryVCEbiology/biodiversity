    <h1>Case Study 1. Koala Conservation</h1>
</div>
<div class="content">
    <p class="intro">This case study is designed to be an introduction into environmental case studies. Koala conservation in this case study demonstrates how populations differ in different habitats on the eastern side of Australia. Whilst this case study is well publicised and deals with the ‘cute and fuzzy’, it can be used to focus on human and/or non-human threats to biodiversity. The over-abundance of koalas in the Otways demonstrates how detrimental balance in an ecosystem is, whilst forest clearing in New South Wales and Queensland shows how rapidly a species can decline. This case study is expected to take up 2-4 hours of class time.</p>

        <div class="activity">
            <p>Activity 1.1 - <strong>Discussion points</strong></p>
            <p>The following statements highlight points taken from a scientific journal article that could be used as a basis for a research project, scientific poster or just to promote scientific thinking using problem-based learning.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Koalas are experiencing major declines in the north, while southern populations are relatively stable or increasing.</li>
                <li>New threats are looming, such as climate change and mining, whereas the long-standing threats remain undiminished.</li>
                <li>Conservation and management policies must consider all threats and their interactions, and not just focus on one or two.</li> 
                <li>Much more needs to be done to recover northern koala populations and sustainably manage southern populations.</li>

            <p>Large gumnuts can also be used in this experiment with good results. It shows how fire/heat opens seedpods and stimulates germination very much like a bushfire would for the manna gum woodlands.</p>
