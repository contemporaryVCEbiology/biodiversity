    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This teaching resource is a collection of case studies based on VCE Environmental Science Unit 3: Area of Study 1, Outcome 1: Threats to biodiversity and Protection and restoration of biodiversity. The purpose of this resource is to support the teacher by having access to case studies that introduce date analysis into VCE Environmental Science. This resource addresses three case studies to cover content that aligns with the VCE Environmental Science Study Design 2017-2021 Unit 3 Area of Study 1 Outcome 1. The intent of this collection of case studies is to pool useful resources together to provide the user with a ‘one stop shop’ for locating information relevant to AoS1, Outcome 1: Threats to biodiversity and Protection and restoration of biodiversity. These case studies are designed to align with the pedagogy of problem-based learning to invoke deep critical thinking in the learner.</p>
